    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was showing my friends something on the internet the other day when I realized they didn&rsquo;t know how to hotkey between tabs. Both of them were engineers, one even a software. It blew my mind that people don&rsquo;t know these things, which got my thinking about what I used. I ended up making a list&hellip; so I figured I might as well share it. I&rsquo;ll throw on a quick summary for why I use all these things</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mostly found these small workflow shortcuts though annoyance at multiple keystrokes or dislike of leaving the keyboard.</p>

<p>Chrome Shortcuts
-opt+cmd+del for chrome history
-Switching between tabs, jumping between tabs
-Moving to address bar
Gmail Shortcuts</p>

<p>Chrome Extensions:
Vimium, I couldn&rsquo;t live without this one. It lets you use chrome with vim inspired shortcuts. Hit &rsquo;d' to go down half a page, &lsquo;k&rsquo; to scroll up, &lsquo;gi&rsquo; to move cursor to a textarea then &lsquo;tab&rsquo; to move to the next textarea, etc
Papaly, I have two tabs pinned&hellip; gmail and papaly. Papaly lets me save links in a quick and organized manner, letting me keep my browser uncluttered
Facebook: News Feed Blocker, Facebook Unseen (I know this should be in App-Specific&hellip; but for real). When you open facebook to jump on the messenger, the feed is less likely to draw you in&hellip; and unseen so that you can read messages without beening inclined to answer them until it&rsquo;s more convenient. Remember when the &lsquo;seen at 4:21&rsquo; feature was new and everyone despised it?
Empty New Tab Page, Because it cleans up your interface ever so slightly, &ldquo;a clean room is a clean mind&rdquo;
Imagus
Privacy: Ghostery, TrackMeNot, uBlockOrigin
goo.gl URL Shortener</p>

<p>Flux
Moom
Copy Clip
VPN
Dropbox (Sublime text) -> Nebulous
Evernote</p>

<p>Peace of Mind: Crashplan, Mint, 1Password</p>

<p>App Specific: Mint Mojito, Google Calendar Scroll Disabler, The Camelizer, Reddit Enhancement Suite, Download FB Album mod, Boomerang for gmail</p>

<p>Maybe:
Pomodoro Timer</p>
