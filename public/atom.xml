<h4><strong>Important Note: Nothing I did worked the first time, so I was constantly forced to solve new problems and learn new things</strong></h4>

<h3>Art of the CommandLine</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in learning the CommandLine better. So I was pretty excited to find this guide on Hackernews, or was it r/programming? <a href="https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line">The Art of the CommandLine</a> works as an overview of the most useful things, giving a short introduction so you know what&rsquo;s what. You can then look more into the things using &lsquo;man&rsquo; or a quick google search.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a portion of my raw notes (things that were relatively new to me):</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyday Use:

<ul>
<li>xargs (example makes no sense)</li>
<li>HERE document (code block that io redirects list to a command)</li>
<li>mosh (ssh type thing using udp)</li>
<li>percol/fzf (interactive selection of values from output of another command)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Processing Files and Data:

<ul>
<li>uniq (uniq reports or filters out repeated lines in a file, these would be perfect for lucky times)</li>
<li>cut/paste/join, pretty intuitive names but never used or seen these used before</li>
<li>awk/sed, awk is a pattern directed scanning and processing language, sed is a stream editor</li>
<li>repren, for complex renames</li>
<li>rysnc, versatile and fast file copying tools</li>
<li>shuf, shuffle or select random names</li>
<li>patch, works with diff to be the standard for patching source code</li>
<li>hd/hexdump/xxd/bvi/biew/strings+grep/xdelta3 for binary files&hellip;</li>
<li>iconv, convert text encodings</li>
<li>split/csplit to split by size or pattern</li>
<li>zless, zmore, zcat, zgrep to operate on compressed files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cool things:

<ul>
<li>Press ctrl-r repeatedly to cycle through more matches,&hellip; or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current -line</li>
<li>ctrl-a, #, enter //enters command as comment so you can go back and edit it later</li>
<li>Brace expansion using {&hellip;}, cp somefile{,.bak} (which expands to cp somefile somefile.bak)</li>
<li>The output of a command can be treated like a file via &lt;(some command). ie, vim &lt;(env)</li>
<li>man ascii</li>
<li>tmux/screen to multiplex the screen (byobu to enhance tmux, dtach for session persistence)</li>
<li>fpp (pathpicker) looks incredibly useful</li>
<li>tab literal, ctrl-v [Tab] or write $&lsquo;\t&rsquo; (the latter is better as you can copy/paste it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>After going through this I decided to dive deeper into:</p>

<ul>
<li>xargs</li>
<li>grep</li>
<li>vim</li>
<li>tmux/dtach (although I wasn&rsquo;t happy with dtach and use tmuxinator instead)</li>
<li>zsh</li>
<li>profiles (terminal, bash, key remapping, etc)</li>
<li>cleaning up my environment (ex: had brew and macports fighting with eachother)</li>
</ul>


<p>Notes:
OS X Only:
-&ldquo;To enable the Option key in Mac OS Terminal as an alt key (such as used in the commands above like alt-b, alt-f, etc.), open Preferences -> Profiles -> Keyboard and select "Use Option as Meta key&rdquo;.&ldquo;
-How to change option to meta key properly: <a href="http://goo.gl/jrJDW">http://goo.gl/jrJDW</a>
-Holy shit now emacs is usable, and it was easy to fix</p>

<h3>Mastering Vim</h3>

<p>I used vim a lot of school, but just got by rather than pushing the boundaries of what it can actually do. Yes I do love sublime text and neat things it can do like multiple cursors. But vim is incredible, and there is a reason people have been using it for decades.</p>

<p>Inspired by The Art of the CommandLine, I found this, <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/">Mastering Vim</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a portion of my notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>u and U interaction is unintuitive to me</li>
<li>CTRL+G, line number+G</li>
<li>CTRL-O, CTRL-I</li>
<li>%</li>
<li>:#,#s/old/new/g</li>
<li>:%s/old/new/g</li>
<li>:%s/old/new/gc</li>
<li>:!</li>
<li>:set ic hls is</li>
<li>:set incsearch</li>
<li>:set noic</li>
<li>:nohlsearch</li>
<li>/ignore\c</li>
<li>:e (followed by CTRL+D)</li>
<li>CTRL+L for redraw</li>
<li>CTRL+[ for ESC</li>
<li>CTRL+E for scroll up</li>
<li>CTRL+Y for scroll down</li>
<li>zz, zt, zb for scroll</li>
</ul>


<p>To practice I went through vimtutor and played <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">vim adventures</a>. Now I&rsquo;m making a Javascript game with the Phaser framework that will make use of vim commands for controls</p>

<h3>Tmux</h3>

<p>Tmux would have been an absolute lifesaver when I was back in school. Since I did a lot of my work by sshing into the school servers. So many regrets.</p>

<p>First thing I did was change to prefix from Ctrl+a to Ctrl+b.</p>

<p>The Art of the CommandLine recommended dtach for session persistence, but I found it didn&rsquo;t work very smoothly. Setting up Tmuxinator solved the problem though.</p>

<h3>Profiles</h3>

<p>You can find most of my <a href="https://github.com/nmlau/profiles">Profiles</a> here. This allows them to be cloned in and set up easily. Also allows me to keep track of them in one place. Since hitting &lsquo;ls -al&rsquo; in ~/ is kind of messing.</p>

<p>I did a lot of messing around with my profiles and environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>setup zsh and oh my zsh</li>
<li>installed solarized dark theme for terminal</li>
<li>changed to iTerm2</li>
<li>remapped keys: caps to control, remapping vims &lsquo;jk&rsquo; to escape</li>
<li>got rid of macports and fixed brews permissions (lots of running &lsquo;brew doctor&rsquo;)</li>
<li>changed host/terminal name</li>
</ul>


<h3>One-liner for Killing Applications</h3>

<p>[2] Figure out how to combine kill processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask on Stackoverflow?</li>
<li>kill <code>jobs -ps</code> # Kill jobs running in background</li>
<li>ps -ax | grep Finder</li>
<li>kill -9 390</li>
<li>zsh: jobs -p | awk &lsquo;{print $3}&rsquo; | xargs kill</li>
<li>ps -ax | grep Finder | awk &lsquo;{print $3}&rsquo;</li>
<li>ps -ax | grep &lsquo;TextEdit&rsquo; | awk &lsquo;{print $1}&rsquo; | xargs kill -9</li>
<li>Bash functions for replacement text, <a href="http://goo.gl/zqlude">http://goo.gl/zqlude</a></li>
<li>Single in double quotes or vice versa to escape, <a href="http://goo.gl/ccL5mp">http://goo.gl/ccL5mp</a></li>
<li>alias blah=&lsquo;function <em>blah(){ echo &ldquo;First: $1&rdquo;; echo &ldquo;Second: $2&rdquo;; };</em>blah&rsquo;</li>
<li>alias killapp=&lsquo;function <em>killapp(){ps -ax | grep Finder};</em>killapp&rsquo;</li>
<li>alias killapp=&lsquo;function <em>killapp(){ps -ax | grep $1 | awk &rsquo;{print $1}&lsquo; | xargs kill -9};</em>killapp&rsquo;</li>
<li>alias killapptest=&lsquo;function <em>killapp(){arg1=&ldquo;$1&rdquo;; ps -ax | grep $arg1};</em>killapp&rsquo; //using variable</li>
<li>alias killapptest=&lsquo;function <em>killapp(){arg1=&ldquo;$1&rdquo;; ps -ax | grep $arg1 | awk &ldquo;{print $1}&rdquo;;</em>killapp&rsquo; //using variable</li>
<li>FINAL:
alias killapp=&lsquo;function <em>killapp(){ps -ax | grep $1 | awk &ldquo;{print \$1}&rdquo; | xargs kill -9};</em>killapp&rsquo;</li>
<li>Not perfect, grep seems to find itself</li>
<li>pgrep or &lsquo;ps aux | grep -v grep | grep &ldquo;fnord&rdquo;&rsquo; would fix finding itself, <a href="http://goo.gl/H9XhRL">http://goo.gl/H9XhRL</a></li>
<li>Running simplehttp server on different port, but don&rsquo;t run below 1024, <a href="http://goo.gl/tvTJmx">http://goo.gl/tvTJmx</a></li>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start with a disclaimer: This isn&rsquo;t a guide. This is <em>my</em> fitness journey, how I achieved <em>my</em> goals with the time and effort <em>I</em> was willing to put forth. Although, at the same time, I&rsquo;m a pretty normal guy so maybe these things will apply to you as well. Also, friends will often ask for advice so I figure I can just direct them here rather than attempt to cover everything poorly in person, and have them not retain that much.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Since June I&rsquo;ve gone from 139 lbs to 143 lbs. From:</p>

<ul>
<li>67.2 lbs of Skeletal Muscle Mass, 21.2 lbs of Body Fat Mass, with a 15.1 Body Fat percentage</li>
<li>72.3 lbs of Skeletal Muscle Mass, 16.3 lbs of Body Fat Mass, with a 11.4 Body Fat percentage</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s some of my lifts, I&rsquo;ve mostly moved into intermediate going on proficient territory. So I&rsquo;m pretty happy but I&rsquo;ve got a long ways to go:</p>

<h3>What I used to Do</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been casually interested in fitness. I was raised on sports, and have played the majority of sports with my friends at some point. From rugby, wrestling, wiffleball, ping pong, etc. I ran track and cross country in highschool which got me a free member ship to the gym. So I would jog over to the local gym and work out on the machines, religiously following the given Range of Motion. I would do sets of 75 ten pound dumbbell curls, pushups to feel more productive while watching the sharks or warriors play.</p>

<p>During university, I would find routines off the internet, often combining them into some strange amalgamation based on what I thought was best. I would drink whey protein, and make mediocre progress until midterms or finals came by and then start all over again. Overall, I saw little progress over the course of 4 years.</p>

<h3>Transition to Power Lifting</h3>

<p>Then I discovered power lifting. This by itself wasn&rsquo;t the most important thing, that was the resources it lead me too. But we&rsquo;ll get to that later. I picked up the beginner powerlifing routine Stronglifts 5x5s. Yes, I was still a beginner after 4 years. This routine forced me to pick up a bunch of important lifts that I had been neglecting or had been too afraid to try, such as Squats, Deadlifts, and Overhead Press. It made them easy to pick up by starting the weights very low. It provided things beyond lifts and reps, such as when to deload.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Under Construction</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in learning Javascript, but have been too overwhelmed by the abundance of resources out there. I finally took the time to do some thorough looking around with lead me to this Stack Overflow <a href="http://goo.gl/iPMGV">link</a> on resources for learning Javascript. This lead me to the MDN Javascript Reintroduction and Crockfords Lectures.</p>

    <updated>2015-12-03T00:26:08-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://octopress.nicksdevspot.com/blog/2015/12/03/favorite-tools-and-tricks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was showing two of my engineer buddies something on my laptop when I realized they didn&rsquo;t know how to shortcut between tabs. It blew my mind that people don&rsquo;t know these things, which got my thinking about all the little tips and tricks I&rsquo;ve picked up over the years. I ended up making a list&hellip; so I figured I might as well share it. I&rsquo;ll throw on a quick summary for why I use all these things. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Google</em>, Really really good search engine. A strong alternative to Bing if you&rsquo;re willing to give up the $125/year that Microsoft will give you for clicks.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve mostly found these through annoyance at minor inconveniences, whether they be multiple keystrokes or the laborious task of moving my hands to the keyboard and back.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Chrome Shortcuts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove item from search bar and history, opt+cmd+del</li>
<li>Switching between tabs, shift+opt+{} or ctrl+shift+tab</li>
<li>Jumping between tabs, cmd+(0-9)</li>
<li>Moving to address bar, cmd+L</li>
</ul>


<h3>Gmail Shortcuts (have to enable them)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Refresh inbox, U</li>
<li>Move between messages, j/k</li>
<li>Archive and Move between messages, {/}</li>
<li>Move to search bar, /</li>
<li>Open message, o</li>
<li>Move between Folders, g+(i for inbox)(t for sent)(l for label)(s for starred)(a for all)</li>
<li>Compose, c</li>
<li>Send, cmd+enter</li>
</ul>


<h3>Chrome Extensions</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Vimium</em>, I couldn&rsquo;t live without this one. It lets you use chrome with vim inspired shortcuts. Hit &rsquo;d' to go down half a page, &lsquo;k&rsquo; to scroll up, &lsquo;gi&rsquo; to move cursor to a textarea then &lsquo;tab&rsquo; to move to the next textarea, etc.</li>
<li><em>Papaly</em>, I have two tabs pinned&hellip; gmail and papaly. Papaly lets me save links in a quick and organized manner, letting me keep my browser uncluttered.</li>
<li><em>Empty New Tab Page</em>, Because it cleans up your interface ever so slightly, &ldquo;a clean room is a clean mind&rdquo;.</li>
<li><em>Imagus</em>, hover to see full size image. Have it configured to show image on shift press.</li>
<li><em>goo.gl URL Shortener</em>, this is very particular to my workflow. Whenever I find something valuable on the internet, I&rsquo;ll throw a quick summary and it&rsquo;s goog.gl link on a plain text to review later.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Privacy</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Ghostery</em>, Ghostery blocks 3rd party trackers, make sure to disable GhostRank.</li>
<li><em>TrackMeNot</em>, clicks every ad (but doesn&rsquo;t load them) to obfuscate your actual activity.</li>
<li><em>uBlockOrigin</em>, uBlockOrigin, largely superior Adblock Plus. More efficient.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Software</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Flux</em>, reduces eyestrain by adapting your computer screen to the time of day. Takes some adjusting to. But after that you won&rsquo;t be able to live without it.</li>
<li><em>Moom</em>, window management, lets me move my windows anywhere I want with an efficient hotkey. Mandatory if you&rsquo;re working with larger monitors (I have a 27" and 24").</li>
<li><em>VPN</em>, lets me feel safe when I&rsquo;m on public wifi. Was especially useful when I backed around Asia. I personally use Private Internet Access (PIA), one of the bigger providers.</li>
<li><em>Copy Clip</em>, clipboard manager for os x. It&rsquo;s free, why not?</li>
<li><em>Google Spreadsheets</em>, have several of these setup for subjects that require more organization. Is conveniently synced between phone and computers.</li>
<li><em>Pomodoro Timer</em>, more for my workflow. I work on tasks in 30 minute chunks so its perfect.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Knowledge base</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Sublime Text</em>, have it opened with entire Dropbox directory. cmd+shift+f executes an interactive grep-like search, makes it very easy to find what I&rsquo;m looking for. cmd+t lets me quickly open whatever file I want.</li>
<li><em>Nebulous for iOS</em>, plain text editor and Dropbox compatibility. Lets me view and edit my knowledge base. Great for my todo lists and to productively kill time when I&rsquo;m waiting in line.</li>
<li><em>Dropbox</em>, keeps everything synced. Although I did have to pay for more storage.</li>
<li><em>Org mode</em>, incredible! Plan to integrate this into workflow shortly.</li>
<li><em>Evernote</em>, you all know what this is. I&rsquo;m not it&rsquo;s biggest fan, eventually I want to move to an org mode + dropbox + sublime/nebulous workflow. But for now, I use its reminders to re-expose me to particularily interesting pieces of knowledge. Huge issues include: inconvenient exporting, no multiple hierachies of notes/notebooks, ads everywhere, general bugginess.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Sublime Text</h3>

<ul>
<li>ctrl+cmd+up/down arrows, swap rows up and down.</li>
<li>ctrl+shift+up/down arrows, quickly spawn multiple cursors for some efficient editing.</li>
<li>cmd+k then cmd+b, hide/show sidebar</li>
</ul>


<h3>OS X</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Spotlight</em>, cmd+space. Let&rsquo;s you find anything on your computer quickly and conveniently. Whether it&rsquo;s an application, file, widget.</li>
<li><em>Hot Corners</em>, move the mouse to bottom left or right corner to put my laptop to sleep. Lets me take faster bathroom breaks at the coffee shop.</li>
<li>Remapping Caps to Control at OS level (Modifier Keys). Especially useful for the Command Line Interface. Who uses Caps Lock anyways.</li>
<li>PLEASE NEVER MOVE THROUGH TEXT BY HOLDING THE ARROW KEYS (and try to avoid the mouse). cmd+left/right arrows, move to beginning or end of line. option+left/right arrow, move a word at a time, similar to vim&rsquo;s &lsquo;w&rsquo; and &lsquo;b&rsquo; commands.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Peace of Mind</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Crashplan</em>, backs up my computer to a remote location every night while I&rsquo;m sleeping. I backup with my harddrive weekly for a local backup. So unless the right data center and my house burn down simultaneously I&rsquo;m fine.</li>
<li><em>Mint</em>, free personal budgeting application. I used to constantly worry about whether I was getting mischarged, having my credit cards stolen, or paying fees I shouldn&rsquo;t be. With this I can check every couple days and never have to worry.</li>
<li><em>1Password</em>, just in case I forget. Sync my keychain over dropbox so it&rsquo;s available in case of emergencies.</li>
</ul>


<h3>App Specific</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Mint Mojito</em>, improves ui for mint. You can cut out sections you don&rsquo;t want, like: recommendations, ads, etc&hellip;</li>
<li><em>Google Calendar Scroll Disabler</em>, because the trackpad is way too sensitive and I often found myself a year ahead of where I wanted to be.</li>
<li><em>The Camelizer</em>, tracks Amazon prices. Let&rsquo;s you see if you&rsquo;re getting a good deal or should wait.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Under Construction</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><img src="http://octopress.nicksdevspot.com/images/pi/pi.jpg" title="'pi.jpg'" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always had trouble waking up. Sometimes I wake up, sometimes I don&rsquo;t, sometimes I just end up lying in bed&hellip; it&rsquo;s been a lifetime point of stress. But in the last few months I&rsquo;ve found a solution that works for me. I use the <a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle Phone App</a> to gently wake me up so I&rsquo;m ready for my out of bed alarm that goes off at 630 (weekdays) or 830 (weekends). This forces me to get out of bed to walk across the room and turn it off.</p>

<p>But with the larger problem solved, there&rsquo;s always more you can do to make it more perfect. Right now I&rsquo;m using an iPad as my out of bed alarm. There&rsquo;s a lot of problems here: it&rsquo;s a really pricey device being used for a very simple task, it can be inefficient to turn off or adjust alarm times (I don&rsquo;t enjoy the gui), the battery will eventually run out, and if I wake up early there&rsquo;s no kill button to stop my normal alarm from going off without remembering to turn them back on.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pros though, the battery lasts for several weeks, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be plugged in (I&rsquo;m a little OCD and don&rsquo;t want extra wires).</p>

<p>On top of this, I&rsquo;ve been hearing about Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s for years and have always wanted to mess around with one. This seemed like the perfect project to get started on the DIY journey.</p>

<p>Note: this isn&rsquo;t so much of a guide as my reflections on my journey to solidify the things I learned.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>How I chose my components, used these two guides: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/138281/the-htg-guide-to-getting-started-with-raspberry-pi/all/">Getting Started Guide</a> and <a href="http://www.htpcbeginner.com/raspberry-pi-accessories-for-xbmc-media-center/2/">Component Guide</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I bought:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alliedelec.com/raspberry-pi-raspberry-pi-2-model-b/70465426/">Raspberry Pi 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TA0AUW/">MicroSD Card - Transcend Class 10</a> (preferably preloaded with NOOBS, but it&rsquo;s easy to set it up yourself)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MTTJOY">WiFi Adapter - Edimax</a> I got the Edimax rather than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EQT0YK2/">Panda 300Mbps</a>, because it has a nano adapter and the Panda is overkill at 300Mbps. Or just use ethernet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OY7HR1U">Power Adapter - Northpada</a> Northpada because better reviews, higher mAH, one piece charger. In hindsight, I should have just used one of the many micro USB cables I have sitting around and plugged them into a usb outlet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MQLB1N6">Case</a>, although at first I accidentally bought the a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TCUXLW">Model 1 Case</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Already owned:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-27-Inch-LED-Lit-Monitor/dp/B00P0EQD1Q">Monitor</a>, any monitor will do. HDMI is more convenient though</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.daskeyboard.com/products/das-keyboard-ultimate-model-s">Keyboard</a>, you can use any usb keyboard, I had a few lying around. Wireless is always convenient too</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TG75EG">Mouse</a>, and any usb mouse. Wireless always good</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002L5R78">HDMI Display Cable</a>, Raspberry Pi has a HDMI display port, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got one lying around. Or if your monitor can&rsquo;t do HDMI, use one of the many adapters out there. All modern display cables are digital and can be converted from one to another.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00316263Y">Ethernet</a>, Got hundreds of these too</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YARCGOC">Speaker</a>, Choose the favorite one you&rsquo;ve got lying around. All you need is a 3.5mm Audio cable to plug it in</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://ozzmaker.com/2013/10/24/how-to-control-the-gpio-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-an-ir-remote/">Messing with Infrared</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/389">Mini Remote Control (IR)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/157">IR Receiver Sensor</a></li>
<li>Ribbon Cable</li>
<li>Breadboard</li>
<li>3 LEDs</li>
<li>Wires (3 for LED Positives, 3 for LED Negatives, 3v3 power to IR Out, Ground to IR GND, GPIO 18 - PCM_CLK to IR Vs)</li>
<li><a href="http://ozzmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IRwiring2.png?csspreview=true">R1 270n, whatever the yellow boxes are</a></li>
<li>Note: Might be able to attach IR sensor straight to GPIO. ALso, LEDs and most wires are just for testing</li>
</ul>


<p>Optional:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heatsink, don&rsquo;t think you need this unless I&rsquo;m running HD video constantly. A lot of people, like my dad, use their Pi&rsquo;s as DVRs</li>
</ul>


<p>I ended up doing a headless setup where I ssh&rsquo;d in from my laptop (more on this later). This eliminated the need for: Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Display Cable. And switching to ethernet meant no need for a wifi adapter</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download Noobs (make sure not copy files in, not the folder)</li>
<li>Download and use formatter, make sure to have lock switch off</li>
<li>Plug everything in</li>
<li>Turn on, Install Raspian</li>
<li>Initial Settings screen: Turn on SSH, expand filesystem</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=74176">Setting up headless</a>:
I&rsquo;m a little bit of a neat freak. And I don&rsquo;t have enough space at the moment for a dedicated work bench. So shortly after I went through all the trouble of acquiring and plugging in all the components plugged in I realized I could do better. A headless setup means all the pi needs is an internet connection (wifi adapter or ethernet) and I can use it over ssh.</p>

<p>I got to learn a lot about networking, having to mess around with commands like &lsquo;arp -a&rsquo;, &lsquo;nmap&rsquo;, modifying /etc/ssh/ssh_config, <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/mac-address">learn about MAC and ARP addresses</a></p>

<p>Even once I was connected, the workflow was mediocre until I was able to setup:
File Transfer using <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8950/copy-files-from-osx-to-from-pi">afp (appletalk protocol) to pi</a>
-Install netatalk on pi, afp in from mac
-This let me use finder and all my os x apps to access my pi&rsquo;s files. Much better than the trouble I was having with Filezilla. Incredibly convenient although it did leave hidden .AppleDouble folders in every directory
Another huge thing was using tmux combined with dtach. Tmux meant I only had to ssh in one time, then I could split that session into several windows. dtach allowed me to shut the pi off, ssh back in jump right back to my desired tmux session.</p>

<p>Random note: sshing in forced me to use command line a lot. Which inspired me to read a few <a href="">guides on CLI</a>, <a href="">vim</a>, that got me play with my profiles (my vim is beautiful now - <a href="">image of Solarized profile</a>) to setup my profiles like <a href="https://github.com/nmlau/profiles">this</a></p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>Source available on <a href="https://github.com/nmlau/RPiAlarm">github</a></p>

<p>I got my inspiration from: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=julETnOLkaU">Speaking Alarm Clock</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skiwithpete/alarmpi">github available here</a>. And some better <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=41&amp;t=95500">Alternative Alarm Clock Projects</a>, most notably the <a href="https://github.com/bubbl/SimpleGoogleAlarmClock">Simple Google Alarm Clock</a></p>

<p>One set the alarm with chronjobs, another by hardcoding, but I really liked the Google Calendar integration. And plan to add some pyfeed stuff, particularily to get weather. I also stole how they used datetime module, config parser, os and mpg123 to play sound files. However, all these projects were deprecated because of changes to the Google Calendar Service API.</p>

<p>One of them suggested setting up a socket to listen for real world events, so I&rsquo;m setting one up to work with an Infrared Remote (IR).</p>

<h3>Brickwalls</h3>

<p>Here are some problems that took longer to solve than they should have. In other words, things I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup was actually the longest part, I had to follow a lot of tutorials that didn&rsquo;t work without going in and understanding the commands better</li>
<li>Changes in Google Calendar API also slowed me down more than they should have. I accidentally setup the deprecated API at first&hellip; wish they had thrown a note on the article that it had been deprcated two years ago!</li>
<li>Just learning python so had some trouble here, easily fixed though. Just read some guides, learned syntax better, got the normal tools like pdb for debugger</li>
<li>Learned how to use a GPIO, got my EE friends to show me how to use a breadboard, ribbon cable, wiring, etc. Closest I had gotten to this stuff before was an FPGA in my embedded systems course or using VHDL to design a CPU although no actual hardware was involved in that.</li>
<li>Time was a huge hassle, I learned a lot about how the time modules worked together, and about formatting. I&rsquo;ll probably swap that all out at some point and just use the arrow module</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some of my favorite quotes from A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I should like to ask you: -Does your childhood seem far off? Do the days when you sat at your mother&rsquo;s knee, seem days of very long ago?</p>

<p>Responding to his softened maner, Mr. Lorry answered:</p>

<p>Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some of my favorite quotes from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius:</p>

<p>Book 6.54</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That which is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee either.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Book 7.7</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Think not so much of what you lack as of what you have: but of the things that you have, select the best, and then reflect how eagerly you would have sought them if you did not have them. At the same time, however, take care that you do not through being so pleased with them accustom yourself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if you should ever not have them.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>Book 8.48</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible, when, self-collected, it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing that it does not choose to do, even if it resists from mere obstinacy. What then will it be when it forms a judgment about anything aided by reason and deliberately? Therefore the mind that is free from passions is a citadel, for man has nothing more secure to which he can fly for refuge and repel every attck. He then who has not seen this is an ignorant man; but he who has seen it and does not fly to this refuge is unhappy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Book 11.10</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no nature that is inferior to art, for the arts imitate the nature of things. But if this is so, that nature which is the most perfect and the most comprehensive of all natures cannot fall short of the skill of art. Now all arts do the inferior things for the sake of the superior; therefore the universal nature does so, too.</p></blockquote>

<p>Book 11.27</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that we may be reminded of those bodies that continually do the same things and in the same manner perform their work, and also be reminded of their purity and nudity. For there is no veil over a star.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, I didn&rsquo;t take down the quote for this. But something very valuable I learned from this book is: If you&rsquo;re ashamed too ashamed to tell others about what you&rsquo;ve done. Then learn and don&rsquo;t do the same thing in the future.</p>

<p>While Vietnam was more of an adventure, Japan fell on the vacation side. The hospitality was incredible and the hostels felt like 5 star hotels. The cuisine was full of novel tastes and textures. The culture was quirky and energetic. Most importantly though, I got to visit one of my homelands, something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do.</p>

<p>When I set out on the biggest adventure of my life, I was afraid it somehow wouldn&rsquo;t match up to expectations. And expectations were high after hearing stories and having wanted to go for years. So I&rsquo;m happy to say that Vietnam was perfect, it was a crazy and exhilarating adventure of strange things and marvelous places.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights from the trip:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why stories appeal to us. They give us the clarity and simplicity our real lives lack&rdquo; - Patrick Rothfuss. Since I love stories, whether they are from books or movies or tv&hellip; this quote struck me. However, I think that the hunt for clarity and simplicity applies beyond stories to everything that I love, to all the hobbies that I enjoy. I do not expect to ever understand life enough that I might claim that it is simple. However, I will certainly try. I feel that my best chance is to pick small pockets of life as hobbies and over a lifetime of learning, achieve a high level of understanding (or clarity).</p>

<p>I have always loved clarity. When I played hockey in high school, I loved starting a rush up the ice, all the possibilities laid bare before me. Or studying for a final as I could feel all the information consolidating, seeing how interconnected all the details were and understanding the flow of the subject matter. Thus, I loved games, learning their inner workings and obsessing over them until I could see several steps ahead. I loved learning because if you studied hard enough and read deep enough into the subject then there was no need to memorize, it would become natural and simply make sense.</p>

<p>But games come and go. The one constant has become programming, it is the ultimate hobby since I can get paid for doing it and spend my next 30-40 years exploring its nuisances under the guise of a career. I&rsquo;ll be surrounded with others who have spent decades studying and learn from them. There will be no slacking since I&rsquo;ll be disciplined to spending 40 hours a week. And yes, I will balance it with my personal life and other hobbies. Ultimately though, I see it as my greatest hope for achieving clarity.</p>
