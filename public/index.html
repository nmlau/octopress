<h2>Under Construction</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always had trouble waking up. Sometimes I wake up, sometimes I don&rsquo;t, sometimes I just end up lying in bed&hellip; it&rsquo;s been a lifetime point of stress. But in the last few months I&rsquo;ve found a solution that works for me. I use the <a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle Phone App</a> to gently wake me up so I&rsquo;m ready for my out of bed alarm that goes off at 630 (weekdays) or 830 (weekends). This forces me to get out of bed to walk across the room and turn it off.</p>

<p>But with the larger problem solved, there&rsquo;s always more you can do to make it more perfect. Right now I&rsquo;m using an iPad as my out of bed alarm. There&rsquo;s a lot of problems here: it&rsquo;s a really pricey device being used for a very simple task, it can be inefficient to turn off or adjust alarm times (I don&rsquo;t enjoy the gui), the battery will eventually run out, and if I wake up early there&rsquo;s no kill button to stop my normal alarm from going off without remembering to turn them back on.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pros though, the battery lasts for several weeks, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be plugged in (I&rsquo;m a little OCD and don&rsquo;t want extra wires).</p>

<p>On top of this, I&rsquo;ve been hearing about Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s for years and have always wanted to mess around with one. This seemed like the perfect project to get started on the DIY journey.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>How I chose my components, used these two guides: <a href="http://goo.gl/EOip4i">Getting Started Guide</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/YA8hUI">Component Guide</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I bought:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alliedelec.com/raspberry-pi-raspberry-pi-2-model-b/70465426/">Raspberry Pi 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TA0AUW/">MicroSD Card - Transcend Class 10</a> (preferably preloaded with NOOBS, but it&rsquo;s easy to set it up yourself)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MTTJOY">WiFi Adapter - Edimax</a> I got the Edimax rather than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EQT0YK2/">Panda 300Mbps</a>, because it has a nano adapter and the Panda is overkill at 300Mbps. Or just use ethernet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OY7HR1U">Power Adapter - Northpada</a> Northpada because better reviews, higher mAH, one piece charger. In hindsight, I should have just used one of the many micro USB cables I have sitting around and plugged them into a usb outlet.</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/54ZQH4">Case</a>, although at first I accidentally bought the a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TCUXLW">Model 1 Case</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Already owned:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-27-Inch-LED-Lit-Monitor/dp/B00P0EQD1Q">Monitor</a>, any monitor will do. HDMI is more convenient though</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.daskeyboard.com/products/das-keyboard-ultimate-model-s">Keyboard</a>, you can use any usb keyboard, I had a few lying around. Wireless is always convenient too</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TG75EG">Mouse</a>, and any usb mouse. Wireless always good</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002L5R78">HDMI Display Cable</a>, Raspberry Pi has a HDMI display port, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got one lying around. Or if your monitor can&rsquo;t do HDMI, use one of the many adapters out there. All modern display cables are digital and can be converted from one to another.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00316263Y">Ethernet</a>, Got hundreds of these too</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YARCGOC">Speaker</a>, Choose the favorite one you&rsquo;ve got lying around. All you need is a 3.5mm Audio cable to plug it in</li>
</ul>


<p>Messing with Infrared:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mini Remote Control (IR), <a href="http://goo.gl/xIfdZ">http://goo.gl/xIfdZ</a></li>
<li>IR Receiver Sensor, <a href="http://goo.gl/SkpM2">http://goo.gl/SkpM2</a></li>
<li>Ribbon Cable</li>
<li>Breadboard</li>
<li>3 LEDs</li>
<li>Wires (3 for LED Positives, 3 for LED Negatives, 3v3 power to IR Out, Ground to IR GND, GPIO 18 - PCM_CLK to IR Vs)</li>
<li>R1 270n, whatever the yellow boxes are, (<a href="http://goo.gl/eLDBsQ">http://goo.gl/eLDBsQ</a>)</li>
<li>Note: Might be able to attach IR sensor straight to GPIO. ALso, LEDs and most wires are just for testing</li>
</ul>


<p>Optional:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heatsink, don&rsquo;t think you need this unless I&rsquo;m running HD video constantly. A lot of people, like my dad, use their Pi&rsquo;s as DVRs</li>
</ul>


<p>I ended up doing a headless setup where I ssh&rsquo;d in from my laptop (more on this later). This eliminated the need for: Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Display Cable. And switching to ethernet meant no need for a wifi adapter</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download Noobs (make sure not copy files in, not the folder)</li>
<li>Download and use formatter, make sure to have lock switch off</li>
<li>Plug everything in</li>
<li>Turn on, Install Raspian</li>
<li>Initial Settings screen: Turn on SSH, expand filesystem</li>
</ul>


<p>Setting up headless</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>I got my inspiration from: <a href="https://goo.gl/nq50lE">Speaking Alarm Clock</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skiwithpete/alarmpi">github available here</a>. And some better <a href="https://goo.gl/Ucjzhc">Alternative Alarm Clock Projects</a>, most notably the <a href="https://github.com/bubbl/SimpleGoogleAlarmClock">Simple Google Alarm Clock</a></p>

<h3>Brickwalls</h3>

<p>Here are some problems that took longer to solve than they should have. In other words, things I learned:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some of my favorite quotes from A Tale of Two Cities by Marcus Aurelius:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I should like to ask you:-Does your childhood seem far off? Do the days when you sat at your mother&rsquo;s knee, seem days of very long ago?</p>

<p>Responding to his softened maner, Mr. Lorry answered:</p>

<p>Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (ad I so old!), and by many assocations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed tin me."</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some of my favorite quotes from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius:</p>

<p>Book 6.54</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That which is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee either&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Book 7.7</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Think not so much of what you lack as of what you have: but of the things that you have, select the best, and then reflect how eagerly you would have sought them if you did not have them. At the same time, however, take care that you do not through being so pleased with them accustom yourself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if you should ever not have them&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Book 8.48</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible, when, self-collected, it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing that it does not choose to do, even if it resists from mere obstinacy. What then will it be when it forms a judgment about anything aided by reason and deliberately? Therefore the mind that is free from passions is a citadel, for man has nothing more secure to which he can fly for refuge and repel every attck. He then who has not seen this is an ignorant man; but he who has seen it and does not fly to this refuge is unhappy&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Book 11.10</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no nature that is inferior to art, for the arts imitate the nature of things. But if this is so, that nature which is the most perfect and the most comprehensive of all natures cannot fall short of the skill of art. Now all arts do the inferior things for the sake of the superior; therefore the universal nature does so, too.</p></blockquote>

<p>Book 11.27</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that we may be reminded of those bodies that continually do the same things and in the same manner perform their work, and also be reminded of their purity and nudity. For there is no veil over a star.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, I didn&rsquo;t take down the quote for this. But something very valuable I learned from this book is: If you&rsquo;re ashamed of telling people about something you did. Then learn from that and don&rsquo;t do it in the future</p>

<p>While Vietnam was more of an adventure, Japan fell on the vacation side. The hospitality was incredible and the hostels felt like 5 star hotels. The cuisine was full of novel tastes and textures. The culture was quirky and energetic. Most importantly though, I got to visit one of my homelands, something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do.</p>

<p>I had originally planned to go to China during this period but decided a couple weeks would not be nearly enough time and didn&rsquo;t want to waste a six month, relatively expensive visa on it. So I decided to go to Hong Kong instead.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks Andreas' Visa expired and he headed back to the U.S. The rest of us had planned to head to Indonesia at this point but decided we wanted more time in Vietnam. Zach, Quynh, and Sherrie headed south for the sunny beach resort of Nha Trang while Amber and I set off west for the green hills of Sapa before heading south back into central Vietnam.</p>

<p>When I set out on the biggest adventure of my life, I was afraid it somehow wouldn&rsquo;t match up to expectations. And expectations were high after hearing stories and having wanted to go for years. So I&rsquo;m happy to say that Vietnam was perfect, it was a crazy and exhilarating adventure of strange things and marvelous places.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights from the trip</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why stories appeal to us. They give us the clarity and simplicity our real lives lack&rdquo; - Patrick Rothfuss. Since I love stories, whether they are from books or movies or tv&hellip; this quote struck me. However, I think that the hunt for clarity and simplicity applies beyond stories to everything that I love, to all the hobbies that I enjoy. I do not expect to ever understand life enough that I might claim that it is simple. However, I will certainly try. I feel that my best chance is to pick small pockets of life as hobbies and over a lifetime of learning, achieve a high level of understanding (or clarity).</p>

<p>I have always loved clarity. When I played hockey in high school, I loved starting a rush up the ice, all the possibilities laid bare before me. Or studying for a final as I could feel all the information consolidating, seeing how interconnected all the details were and understanding the flow of the subject matter. Thus, I loved games, learning their inner workings and obsessing over them until I could see several steps ahead. I loved learning because if you studied hard enough and read deep enough into the subject then there was no need to memorize, it would become natural and simply make sense.</p>

<p>But games come and go. The one constant has become programming, it is the ultimate hobby since I can get paid for doing it and spend my next 30-40 years exploring its nuisances under the guise of a career. I&rsquo;ll be surrounded with others who have spent decades studying and learn from them. There will be no slacking since I&rsquo;ll be disciplined to spending 40 hours a week. And yes, I will balance it with my personal life and other hobbies. Ultimately though, I see it as my greatest hope for achieving clarity.</p>
