I was showing my friends something on the internet the other day when I realized they didn't know how to hotkey between tabs. Both of them were engineers, one even a software. It blew my mind that people don't know these things, which got my thinking about what I used. I ended up making a list... so I figured I might as well share it. I'll throw on a quick summary for why I use all these things

I've mostly found these small workflow shortcuts though annoyance at multiple keystrokes or dislike of leaving the keyboard.

Chrome Shortcuts
-opt+cmd+del for chrome history
-Switching between tabs, jumping between tabs
-Moving to address bar
Gmail Shortcuts

Chrome Extensions:
Vimium, I couldn't live without this one. It lets you use chrome with vim inspired shortcuts. Hit 'd' to go down half a page, 'k' to scroll up, 'gi' to move cursor to a textarea then 'tab' to move to the next textarea, etc
Papaly, I have two tabs pinned... gmail and papaly. Papaly lets me save links in a quick and organized manner, letting me keep my browser uncluttered
Facebook: News Feed Blocker, Facebook Unseen (I know this should be in App-Specific... but for real). When you open facebook to jump on the messenger, the feed is less likely to draw you in... and unseen so that you can read messages without beening inclined to answer them until it's more convenient. Remember when the 'seen at 4:21' feature was new and everyone despised it?
Empty New Tab Page, Because it cleans up your interface ever so slightly, "a clean room is a clean mind"
