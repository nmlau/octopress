I want to redo this before publishing.

Hi, for my first post I thought I'd go over how I ended up in Computer Science.

I wasn't one of those kids who decided at 13 years old that they wanted to program and build fascinating new software and applications. My path was more gradual... and I don't even remember exactly how I ended up where I ended up. Perhaps this is why it feels so inevitable that I became a programmer.

Before I started applying to colleges I told my relatives and friends that I was leaning towards the social sciences. I really liked my Junior year United States History AP (USHAP) class as well as enjoying philosophy and psychology (I would often read online articles). Then when I started picking schools and writing essays I wanted to be International Relations so that I could make a difference in the world and learn some history while I was at it. A couple months later when I actually I applied, I checked the management science and business administration boxes because my good friend and I were in this business phase (we had checked out MBA books and wanted to start an FBLA chapter at our school).

I was admitted into several schools and the choice came down to Emory and University of California, San Diego. Emory is a top notch university, a part of the "Southern Ivy League" along with Vanderbilt, and had a great business program. UCSD was a great but not as well known school in sunny San Diego with one of the most reputable Computer Science curriculums (not that I knew this at this point). Had I gone to Emory I probably would have stuck with business, but it was just too expensive and it was an added perk that I got to go to UCSD as a part of the honors program. Yet when I chose UCSD as my future school, I picked Environmental Engineering since my business phase had long since worn off and I always thought engineering was cool, not too mention that green technology seemed like the future (since I had heard it had massive government funding and thus couldn't fail). Furthermore, while I had been good at memorizing information about biology and history, I did not find it overly challenging or exciting. Engineering, and later computer science, offered me a chance to do something that I was uncomfortable with, to build things and apply the knowledge I learned.

So I spent the summer looking forward to going away to university, I signed up for chem and basic engineering along with multivariable calculus... Time passed and finally I got to go to UCSD. Within 2 weeks of reaching UCSD I had picked up the course "Introduction to Computer Science" and changed my major to CS. When it comes down to it I can't really remember how I made the decision... and it was SUCH an important decision. It may have been that I didn't overly enjoy chem or that I was unsure of environmental engineering. It may have had something to do with that I thought my father had been a programmer throughout my childhood (though since I had learned he was EE and did verification). It may have been my love for videogames or that I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley. Sometimes I feel that I should be able to better understand such an important decision. However, I think that it was just an accumlation of factors that made the change inevitable, that when push came to shove that was where I was gonna end up. So when the week 2 deadline for adding courses pushed me to consider whether I wanted to devote my life to environmental engineering... I decided to become Computer Science (luckily this was easy, since I got to UCSD a year or two before Computer Science became an impacted major).

Looking back, I am very glad I made this decision. I could not bear the thought of trading my knowledge of the inner workings of computers for an enhanced understanding of the hardware that they run on. I have a long career ahead of me where my degree will allow me to be a key part of any industry that interests me. Abound with exciting startup opportunities and powerful easy to learn frameworks that will allow me to work in areas that I am truly passionate about.

Finally, during my post graduation break I took a MBTI personality type test. Researching my personality type, I found that it was often summed up in one word: "Engineer". Never before had I felt so at home, so confident in the path that I had chosen to take.
