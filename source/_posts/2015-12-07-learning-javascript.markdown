# Under Construction

### Introduction

I've always been interested in learning Javascript, but have been too overwhelmed by the abundance of resources out there. I finally took the time to do some thorough looking around with lead me to this Stack Overflow [link](http://goo.gl/iPMGV) on resources for learning Javascript. This lead me to the MDN Javascript Reintroduction and Crockfords Lectures.

### Table of Contents

### Crockford on Javascript

* [Volume 1: The Early Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg)
* [Chapter 2: And Then There Was JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO1Wnu-xKoY)
* [Act III: Function the Ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya4UHuXNygM)
  * This talk also convinced me to pick up Little Schemer, promising that it would "change the way you think, and there aren't a lot of books that will do that"
* [Episode IV: The Matamorphasis of Ajax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9qT9joc0M)
* [Part 5: The End of All Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Ceot8yqeI)
* [Scene 6: Loopage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgwSUtYSUqA)
* [Level 7: ECMAScript 5: The new Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTEqr0IlFKY)
* [Section 8: Programming Style & Your Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaEzHI9xyY)

Now that I knew a lot of the theory behind Javascript, it was time to practice applying it. I decided to make a game.
