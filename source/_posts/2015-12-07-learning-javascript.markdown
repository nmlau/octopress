I've always been interested in learning Javascript, but have been too overwhelmed by the abundance of resources out there. I finally took the time to do some thorough looking around with lead me to this Stack Overflow [link](http://goo.gl/iPMGV) on resources for learning Javascript. This lead me to the MDN Javascript Reintroduction and Crockfords Lectures.

* [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Reintroduction](https://goo.gl/89Taee) 

## Crockford on Javascript

* [Volume 1: The Early Years](https://goo.gl/snYql6)
* [Chapter 2: And Then There Was JavaScript](https://goo.gl/Fu8c07)
* [Act III: Function the Ultimate](https://goo.gl/hsLTwc)
* [Episode IV: The Matamorphasis of Ajax](https://goo.gl/XsnSst)
* [Part 5: The End of All Things](https://goo.gl/t6jsVk)
* [Scene 6: Loopage](https://goo.gl/9sqk03)

Now that I knew a lot of the theory behind Javascript, it was time to practice applying it. I decided to make a game.
