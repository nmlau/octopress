Here are some of my favorite quotes from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius:

Book 6.54
>"That which is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee either."

Book 7.7
>"Think not so much of what you lack as of what you have: but of the things that you have, select the best, and then reflect how eagerly you would have sought them if you did not have them. At the same time, however, take care that you do not through being so pleased with them accustom yourself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if you should ever not have them."

Book 8.48
>"Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible, when, self-collected, it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing that it does not choose to do, even if it resists from mere obstinacy. What then will it be when it forms a judgment about anything aided by reason and deliberately? Therefore the mind that is free from passions is a citadel, for man has nothing more secure to which he can fly for refuge and repel every attck. He then who has not seen this is an ignorant man; but he who has seen it and does not fly to this refuge is unhappy."

Book 11.10
>"There is no nature that is inferior to art, for the arts imitate the nature of things. But if this is so, that nature which is the most perfect and the most comprehensive of all natures cannot fall short of the skill of art. Now all arts do the inferior things for the sake of the superior; therefore the universal nature does so, too.

Book 11.27
>"The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that we may be reminded of those bodies that continually do the same things and in the same manner perform their work, and also be reminded of their purity and nudity. For there is no veil over a star."

Book 5.16 (The Best for Last)
>"Such are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with a continuous series of such thoughts as these..."

Finally, I didn't take down the quote for this. But something very valuable I learned from this book is: If you're ashamed too ashamed to tell others about what you've done. Then learn and don't do the same thing in the future.
