### Core Principles and Concepts

====== from important tag

Personal Values:

* Organization, I'm the kid who got in trouble for wandering around the house putting awayclutter. Which says a lot about me as well as a lot about my parents...
* Personal Character/Control
* Engineering/Balance
* Iteration/Learning

Principles:

* Taking action on disappointment
* Great respect for time
* Intelligence is effectiveness
* Meditations Lesson: don't lie, if you're not willing to say the truth then you need to work harder to do things that you're proud of
* 5.16, "Such are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with a continuous series of such thoughts as these..."

* Software Design: reducing complexity for usability and ease of use. Overhead, every system has overhead but with good organization and reduced complexity we want to min-max overhead vs benefits. Iterative review sessions correct for failed cycles/tests/plans. Iterative also checks for misbalancing and targets disappointment. Modularity for flexibility and ability to adapt (extensinble, evolvible). Availability: Mobile/desktop.
* Desiderata

Concepts:

  ☐ "Trying at full effort means that you try less often Or burn out if you try often" (motivation vs willpower)
  ☐ "Be the person that you want people to be" (character)
  ☐ "Everyone has an agenda. If you know yours, you control yourself; if you know theirs, you control them." - Life Advice from 20s (planning and control)

* Where does Discipline fall?
* Trees as way of reducing complexity, system design as modularity
* Recursion to create flow and generate daily tasks from many levels up (long term plans)
* Finding truth with so much data and government deception like New Prizm
* Organzation vs Entropy, effort to cause entropy, effort to reorganize that entropy and learn and rebuild myself in a better way
* Basic Habit Psychology: Chaining, Pre-commitments, Rewards, Barrier Reduction (catch-all)
* Chaining: All I did was tack exercise onto the end of an existing habit chain."
* "I like to think of it this way: if you need willpower to say yes, your default setting is no."
Habits let your default setting be YES!
* "Everyone has an agenda. If you know yours, you control yourself; if you know theirs, you control them."
* In fact, the more uncomfortable you make yourself in life in general, the stronger you will be.
* Mindfulness to avoid stray thoughts, similar to flow
* 21) develop a system for organizing your environment, tools, clothing, home and STRESS
* Failure is good if it's an experiment: Scientific Method is King
* 1% a day in pillars
* The Three of You: Past Present Future (forgive/thank past you)
* Exercise and Books
* Non-Zero Days
* Habits for Motivation (evernote): Don't. Motivation sucks and is ephemeral. Do build incremental improvements into your life and build healthy habits so that a day away from those healthy habits causes you to have LESS of a good day. #quora

* List of Life Advice:
1. "More is lost by indecision than wrong decision".
(If you can't decide, at a certain point you're better off just going with something)
7. "The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously".
(Focus! This is what my routine aims to do)
8. "Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right."
(I've seen this as a problem solving approach, and under Mansons Three Ideas)
* Lastly: Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

Evernotes to revist:
Routine Blurb would make a good intro, but would have to be humanized first
Procrastination Advice
Special section (or did I break this up?)

Methodology:

* Overview of methodology, http://imgur.com/E5pPmva
Set goals, set concrete subgoals, predict roadblocks, roadblock solutions, turn everything into a roadmap

Concepts:

* Willpower/Ego Depletion
* "The Importance of Small Decisions, it's easy to stay in bed when your legs are still sore from yesterday’s…"
* "You Will be Alone, even with your social network, it still has to be you that makes those hard decisions"
* celebrate small things (good way to get into flow state)
* What habit makes the biggest difference in your life with the least amount of effort? Making conscious habits.

Have a plan:
>"Ask any parent and they will tell you the same thing, "I honestly don't know what I did with all my free time before I had kids."  The answer is you did nothing, and now you filled that nothing with a kid....and if you have another kid you'll see that there is a lot of time you're still wasting. When people don't plan, they aren't ready to take advantage of opportunities that avail themselves, and so they play Angrybirds and watch Netflix because it takes less energy than figuring out something to do at that moment.  I call this the "path of least resistance problem."  To make ourselves more sensitive to opportunities that can decidedly improve our lives, we need to structure our routines to make the path of least resistance difficult.  One way to do this is the twenty minutes rule."

>"If you have plans, have re-evaluation periods and benchmarks.  It's hard.  It ain't fun.  But if you don't have goals and dates that those goals need to meet, then you are unlikely to succeed in a lot of things you try to do.  Your goals should be flexible (mine change all the time), but the ones I have, have evaluation periods that I look back and think, "Why am I doing this?"  If I'm not on track to meet the goals, if I feel like I'm missing the mark (or that it's no longer worth it), I evaluate and change course."

* Spending 10-15 minutes everynight writing out a plan for the next day, then sticking to that plan. It helps you keep focused and stops different areas from interferring with eachother since you had already planned everything out.
* It helps you prioritize your activity and time, ask yourself the question: "What activities are crucial to my work, my learning, and health and spiritual goals?" Covering all 3 of these areas everyday is critical, it makes you devote at least a little time to each and thus allows you to grow in each area every day.
* Use your list to end and start your day. As part of the windup/cooldown. If you finished everything then at the end of the day you'll feel great and productive, otherwise you'll have to reflect on what you did wrong!
* Reality: often plan in the morning, or its awesome having a rough weekend plan going in
* BE ENTHUSASTIC, I need to work on this, need more energy! He says that everyone is skeptical and looks for holes in everything when really they just need to embrace new ideas and work with them
* Brick wall journal, started as programming thing but a life one is fantastic. Goes under yearly/quarterly/weekly reviews
* Habits and Plans to beat Procrastination
* Problem finishing anything, ex hard books

Sleeping better:

* Light bulbs ruined our melatonin production
* Dark Sessions 10-30 minutes before sleep (I should meditate in darkness)
* Solution: flux and nightshift

Morning Routine:

* Figure out why you want to wake up early. I could be working on a passion/craft/hobby or for "ME" time, to get a handle on things, get energized, and get clear about yourself, establish goals, and get rolling before the masses wake up.
* This allows you to get ahead of everyone else, and be the one sending orders and being proactive rather than reacting to others
* This time can ONLY be found at the beginning of the day
* Night owls save their passion for late in the day when they're worn out and tired, they "put their interests last"
* Wake up 5 minutes earlier every week. I think 10-15 would be better though

* Get Excited for the morning (looking forward to tea?)
* Get ready for the benefits (envision success), getting up early is linked to many positive things: grades, proactive, ability to ancipate and prepare for problems
* Hints: Start a nighttime routine, get a new alarm clock or put further away

* Physical activity: Move In The Mornings, this gets endorphins into your body which improve energy and focus throughout days. He doesn't offer scientific evidence but it's a pretty common belief. I would like to add quick 30 minute jogs or at least pushups/pullups in the morning. But then I'd need to shower in the mornings...
* Go to bed thanking yourself for your good work: Bring Positivity to bed, you wake up with the similar thoughts you sleep with. So bring positivity and you'll wake up with it
* Ideal morning routine: 15 min fitness, 15 min mental, 30 minutes wash and breakfast/tea, 30 min chill, 1 hour productivity/reading (loosely based on some quora answer?)

Reboot: 
* The original 180 thread post, https://goo.gl/k0t5Bq
* * Escapist quick happy fix rather then following after difficult long term goals, https://goo.gl/jE9l6p
* * One of the many many ways that people use to escape when confronted with a difficult problem (like tetris)

Getting out of comfort zone:
>"Push yourself to know more, learn more, create challenges, overcome those challenges—at the very least, set a time to work on your craft every day, and stick to that time NO MATTER WHAT.  If you don't feel like doing it, good.  Sit with that feeling.  It'll come back again in the future about 10 billion times.  Sit there for 2 hours with that feeling—however long your designated craft time is.  Eventually you'll get so bored that your subconscious will say, "Eh, screw it," and it'll start working.  And the next time you "don't feel like doing it," your subconscious will know it will be put in time-out and be bored to death if it doesn't, so it just dives in."

* Traveling => solving problems => learning to do things

Basics:

* Longterm goals -> yearly goals -> quarterly -> monthly -> weekly -> daily. Goals are framed in terms of mastery rather than (external dependent) performance
* Review sessions, add a lot of overhead so don't do them that often: weekly, yearly. Quarterly?
* Routine is modular: morning, work, evening, cooldown

Tools:

* Filesystem (PKB) -> Dropbox -> Nebulous/ST3
* * ST3: cmd+T for search, cmd+shift+f for interactive grep, sidebar for file system, plaintasks for todo and notes
* * life: 1_plan, 2_todo, 3_today, 4_weekly_review, 2_todo_backofmind, notes (entropy central)
* * file system: hobbies/interests, programming/career, social, routine
* * inbox, desktop/random
* Evernote: key/value store with tag aggregation
* Pomodoro, Wake Up Time
